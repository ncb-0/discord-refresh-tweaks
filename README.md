tweaks to the new discord ui (march 2025), focused on cleaning up the message input box and the user/activity panel

## installation
requires a client mod such as [betterdiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/), [vencord](https://vencord.dev), or [moonlight](https://moonlight-mod.github.io). simply paste the contents of custom.css into the mod's custom css.

## recommended settings
looks best with ui density set to "compact" in discord's main appearance settings.
